### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working as Data Engineer (DE) preprocessing data for Data Science and Analytical purposes

Sometimes I write [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/denstern)

I'm also interested in the development of the blockchain industry, in particular The Open Network (TON):
- [TON - The Open Network](https://github.com/ton-blockchain)
- [Ton Community](https://github.com/ton-community)
